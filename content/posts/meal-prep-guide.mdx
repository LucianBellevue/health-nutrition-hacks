- Keep some ingredients separate (add dressing day-of)
- Freeze some portions for variety later

### Food Safety Guidelines

- Store at 40°F (4°C) or below
- Most prepped meals last 3-4 days
- Freeze meals you won't eat within 4 days

### Time-Saving Hacks

- Purchase rotisserie chicken
- Cook double batches and freeze half

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: Food gets soggy

- **Solution**: Store wet and dry ingredients separately

**Problem**: Running out of time

- **Solution**: Prep in stages (proteins Sunday, veggies Wednesday)

**Problem**: Getting bored

- **Solution**: Rotate 2-3 different meal prep menus

**Problem**: Not enough variety

- **Solution**: Use the "mix and match" method instead of complete meals

## Beyond Meals: Prep These Too

- **Smoothie packs**: Freeze fruit portions in bags
- **Salad jars**: Layer ingredients for grab-and-go
- **Snack boxes**: Portion nuts, fruits, and cheese
- **Sauce prep**: Make dressings and marinades in batches

## Your Action Plan

**Week 1**: Start small

- Prep just lunches for 3 days
- Keep it simple with familiar recipes

**Week 2-3**: Build momentum

- Add breakfast prep
- Increase to 4-5 days of lunches

**Week 4+**: Master the system

- Full week of lunches and dinners
- Experiment with new recipes
- Find your rhythm

## Final Thoughts

Meal prep doesn't have to be perfect or Instagram-worthy. The goal is to make your life easier and support your health goals. Start small, be consistent, and adjust the system to fit your lifestyle.

Remember: The best meal prep system is the one you'll actually stick with!
