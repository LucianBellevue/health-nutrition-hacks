feat: Implement comprehensive author attribution system with E-E-A-T compliance

This commit implements a complete author attribution system for AI-generated
content that satisfies Google's E-E-A-T requirements while supporting both
editorial team (default) and human authors.

## Major Features

### 1. Author Attribution System
- Added editorial team authors for AI-generated content with human review
- Implemented custom author support with full E-E-A-T fields
- Created author selection UI in post editor with dropdown and custom fields
- Default to Editorial Team when no author is selected
- Support for predefined authors (sarah-mitchell, maria-rodriguez, james-chen)

### 2. Content Disclosure Component
- New ContentDisclosure component for AI-assisted content transparency
- Always shows for Editorial Team (default or explicitly selected)
- Never shows for human authors (custom or predefined non-editorial)
- Emphasizes human review, fact-checking, and verification

### 3. Content Freshness Signals
- Updated post dates to use updatedAt when posts are edited
- Shows "Updated: [date]" label for recently edited posts
- Sorted posts by updatedAt to prioritize fresh content
- Updated sitemap to use updatedAt for lastModified

### 4. Enhanced Structured Data
- Editorial team authors use Organization schema type
- Custom/human authors use Person schema type
- Added editor and about fields for editorial review information
- Includes author bio in Person schema for custom authors

### 5. FAQ System Integration
- FAQ extraction from MDX content
- Database storage with Prisma schema
- API endpoint for syncing FAQs
- Editor UI for FAQ management

### 6. Breadcrumb Navigation
- Visible breadcrumb component for better UX
- Complements existing BreadcrumbList structured data
- Integrated into blog post pages

### 7. Image Sitemap
- Added images property to sitemap entries
- Supports both Cloudinary URLs and relative paths
- Improves image discoverability for SEO
